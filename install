# DESCRIPTION:
#
# The install script installs messagesocket package files that have already
# been downloaded to the src sub-directory of the current working directory
# (src/messagesocket).  It marks the msg-c.py and msg-s.py files as executable
# and creates executable links to these files in the bin directory.
#
# Before starting, install checks to see if the papamaclib package has already
# been installed.  If not, it aborts the installation.  If so, it replaces the
# link to papamaclib in src/messagesocket with a valid link to src/papamaclib.
#
# install is designed to be used with papamac's personal package utility
# (p2pkg).  The messagesocket package is downloaded to the current working
# directory using ftp (p2pkg -f) or git (p2pkg -g) and then installed
# (p2pkg -i).  Usage examples are as follows:
#
# p2pkg -fi messagesocket               # Download the messagesocket package
#                                         from the ftp server and install it in
#                                         the current working directory.
# cd /usr/local                         # Download the messagesocket package
# sudo -E p2pkg -gi PiDACS                from github and install it in
#                                         /usr/local.
